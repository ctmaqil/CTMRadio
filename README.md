# CTMRadio
Pre-recorded Radio that works like a Live Radio. 

This project is in testing stages.

What we are trying to accomplish is to be able to have a Live audio stream that is syncronise when playing from other devices with just using HTML, PHP and some Javascript. 

Idea is Client Connect to site> Site get current playlist,time > out put the song at that time> When music ends> Get next song from playlist. 

this way they are in sync with a small delay due to buffering.
